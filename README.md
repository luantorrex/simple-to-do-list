# Simple To-Do Board

This project aims to evolve from a simple list into a lightweight Trello-like board for managing tasks.

## Goals

- [ ] Create multiple lists to organize work
- [x] Add new task cards and delete them
- [ ] Move cards between lists to track progress
- [x] Persist data between sessions
- [ ] Provide an easy-to-use interface

## Getting started

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone it locally.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the board. You can drag task cards between lists to track progress.
4. Your board will automatically save to your browser using `localStorage`, so you can pick up where you left off on your next visit.

## Categories

You can create multiple categories from the sidebar on the left. Each category has its own board with the same layout and functionality. You can also rename or delete categories using the buttons next to each name. All categories and tasks are persisted in your browser's cache.
